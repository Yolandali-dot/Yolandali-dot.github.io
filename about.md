## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi! I'm Yuanxin (Yolanda) Li.  
Iâ€™m a data analyst and quant researcher passionate about building intelligent solutions to financial and operational problems.

I recently graduated from Duke University with a Master's in Quantitative Management. I've worked with Ping An, Guosen Securities, and Bytedance on projects involving ML-based pricing models, quantitative strategies, and risk dashboards.
