## ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

Built a deep learning model using LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM to predict short-term stock prices based on 5 years of historical OHLCV data from Yahoo Finance.  
The model was implemented with TensorFlow/Keras and achieved low prediction errors (MSE: 0.0002) while effectively capturing trend patterns in price sequences.  
> **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Yahoo Finance API
