# Yuanxin (Yolanda) Li  
*Data Analyst | Quantitative Researcher | Risk Modeler*

I’m a data analyst and quantitative researcher passionate about building impactful, intelligent systems at the intersection of finance, machine learning, and risk modeling. I recently completed my Master’s degree in Quantitative Management: Business Analytics at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, where I focused on statistical modeling, data infrastructure, and decision analytics.

Previously, I worked across fintech, securities, and tech firms including **Ping An Technology**, **Guosen Securities**, and **Bytedance**, where I built and deployed scalable machine learning models for asset pricing, marketing optimization, and e-commerce risk detection.

I earned my Bachelor's degree (with honors) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, with a strong theoretical foundation in probability theory, stochastic processes, and differential equations.
